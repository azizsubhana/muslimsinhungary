                    <p>This website is to provide useful information to the muslim community.
                    <br>
                    We understand and respect that the issue of Halal food can be quite complex, and there are a range of opinions surrounding this issue.
                    <br>
                    It is possible that a business listed on this website may also serve non-Halal food or sell/allow alcohol to be brought to the premises. Ultimately it is your personal decision to decide whether or not to dine at these places, and the onus is on you to make the best informed decision.
                    <br>
                    Whilst this website does its best to verify all entries that are added to it, we do not take responsibility for inaccurate or misleading information that is on this site. The Halal status of businesses may change without notice, and it is ultimately your responsibility to verify directly with the business on the accuracy of its Halal status.
                    <br>
                    This website is not associated with any Halal certification organisations, and does not claim to be an authority on the matter in any way, shape or form.
                    <br>
